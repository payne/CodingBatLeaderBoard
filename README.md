I dream of a simple to deploy leader board for CodingBat.com.
People can submit their done URL and then see how they compare
with their friends.  Perhaps deploy as a flask app on AWS lambda?

Right now I have some simple BeautifulSoup4 code that parses my done page.
My done page is hard coded as a HEREIS """ document in the b1.py

Next up... http to fetch done pages and flask?
